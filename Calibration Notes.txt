Calibration procedure:
Have GUI open window to select sensor to calibrate

Prompt user to start pressing down on the reference sensor slowly (3-4 sec)
	Program runs in the background, giving prompt when ready to read data
	Mark beginning time for ionic polymer sensor to be able to go back and analyze data
Prompt user to release sensor quickly (1-2 sec)
	Program finishes after 6 sec and puts respective force data into csv to be read
	Mark end time for use in analyzing
Use the section of ionic polymer sensor data to compare its average slope of the glove sensor to that of the reference sensor

Refer to sensorizedglove.cpp from D:\Ionic_Polymer_Glove\sensorizedglove_Old\Software\sensorizedglovegui\src for r^2 values
and how to get the slope and intersection values to calibrate the sensors (relies on live polling)

Live data polling:
If force data does not contain a value higher than the specified max force, then prompt redo
