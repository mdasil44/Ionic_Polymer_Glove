The process used to create a .exe to be used in the Matlab GUI is as follows:

1) Using Abelardo's files the path to working Visual Studio test code is: *Abelardo*\Software\TestPPSAPI_VS\TestPPS_API
	In this folder, there is a VS solution file (.sln) and an executable file (.exe) in bin\x64
	For editing, the .sln/.cpp in the src folder can be edited and ran in order to produce an updated .exe
	If the .exe requires msvcp140d.dll, Visual Studio 2015 (or 2017) must be installed (if msvcp120d.dll, VS 2013 is required - free setup in Software&HardwareSupport\vs2013.4_dskexp_ENU)

2) Install the Chameleon_TVR program (Software&HardwareSupport\PPS glove\Chameleon 1.8.0.11 Install- OntarioTPS\Chameleon 1.8.0.11 Install)

3) If you take the .exe and move it to a different operating folder, the "HWPlugins", "ProcPlugins", and "setup" folders and "PPSDaqAPI.dll" must be brought with it in order to function 
	Ensure that the setup contains "Reference.cfg" (if not, the files can be found in F:\sensorizedglove_Old\Software\sensorizedglovegui\setup)
