Figure out the PIC code and see if manipulating the reading method may be able to eliminate noise or at least
reduce the noise-to-signal ratio. Use http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/01317A.pdf as a beginning
reference for some methods to reduce the noise in the CTMU, such as using 55 uA rather than .55uA or other to
identify its effect on the signal.

More manipulation of the filter could be done, but the problem is that the signal is subject to electrical "white
noise" which is random and across most frequencies. A reduction in noise is possible, but a complete cancellation
has not been figured out yet. As well, filtering out more frequencies tends to lead to a slower response time,
which is fine for recording data for post-analysis but bad for any measuring any real-time quick movements, since
they will end up having less effect on the signal.
